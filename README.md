🍷 Wine Quality Prediction System
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. It demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline using a clean dataset and a Jupyter Notebook.

📄 Description
The goal of this project is to predict wine quality scores (ranging from 0 to 10) using features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, and more. The notebook includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (e.g., using Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost), evaluation, and visualization of results.
